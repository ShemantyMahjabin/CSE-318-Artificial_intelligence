# CSE-318 – Assignment 02: MAX-CUT via GRASP (Python)

This repository implements **MAX-CUT** heuristics and **GRASP** (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) in Python and evaluates them on a benchmark set of graphs. )
---

## ✨ Features / Algorithms
- **Randomized** construction (averaged over runs)
- **Greedy** construction
- **Semi-Greedy** construction with value-based **RCL** (α ∈ [0,1])
- **Local Search** (1-flip neighborhood; best-improving move)
- **GRASP** = Semi-Greedy + Local Search, repeated for several trials
- Writes a consolidated **CSV** with per-graph results
